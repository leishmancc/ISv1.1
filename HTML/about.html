    <p>Hi, my name is Cole Leishman. I am 23 years old and I live in Lehi
        with my wife Jennifer, and our dog, Rooster. I am originally from
        Alberta, Canada, where I was raised on a ranch with my family. My early life
        for as long as I can remember has been all about the outdoors, working on the ranch,
        training horses, hunting, fishing, working on trucks, and taking care of cows.
        My Dad is a Jr. High principle and my Mom is a dental hygienist. I have 3 younger siblings.
        In highschool I played football and soccer, and I have always loved basketball and baseball as well.
        Later on in life I picked up golf. I am the guy with too many hobbies, when I start something, I go all in.
        I've learned to work on cars, blacksmith knives and steel tools, woodwork, leatherwork, ski, and even 
        build my own bow and arrows. To me that's why my childhood and teenage years were so fun, no one ever
        held me back from chasing my dreams, in fact I had so much help! <Br><br>
        
        I left home after highschool to serve an LDS church mission in Fresno, California.
        After two years in California, I returned to Canada to work on a farm 
        driving tractors and working with cows, so I could save money for college.
        In 2021 I moved to Provo, Utah to study Business and History at BYU. 
        That summer I started doing door to door sales in pest control and 
        fell in love with the sales industry. I also fell in love with Jennifer, a beautiful, Boise State Women's 
        soccer alumni, finishing her education to be an Interior Designer, in Provo UT.
        We were married in the fall of '22 and now live in Lehi, UT.
        Our passion for the outdoors helps us connect, and also makes it hard for us to pick and choose
        activities, because we each have so many passions. <br><br>
       
        My latest passion has been sales. Being able to work in the sales industry has been such
        a blessing to me because it opened my eyes to the true freedom of careers where I get to 
        decide my own worth by showcasing my productivity. I am grateful for my wife and the other important people
        in my life who help me chase my goals.
