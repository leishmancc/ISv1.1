   <p>
        Hello, thank you in advance for taking a look at my resume. 
        My work experience and skills are listed, however I'll offer
        a little explanation anyway. I am 23 years old and I live in Lehi, UT
        with my wife Jen and our dog Rooster. I have been doing door to door pest control
        sales during the summer for two years, in between my studies at Brigham Young University.
        In my first year selling I was in the top three most productive rookies in the entire company, 
        generating over $160k in revenue in a few months. My second year I co-managed a team in Toronto 
        for Vantage Marketing and helped them to be in the top 5 most productive teams in the company on a 
        per-rep average basis, while still generating over $150k in revenue on my own.
        I recently decided to take a break from my studies at BYU in order to pursue job opportunities in 
        sales that I hope will help me explore industries I am pasionate about, and also to give me the capital 
        to be an entrepreneur on my own. Some highlight classes I have taken at BYU are: Professional Sales and Sales Psychology
        taught by Jason Christensen (founder of Northstar), Information Systems (Web dev, HTML, Excel, SQL, VBA), Finance, Economics, Statistics.
